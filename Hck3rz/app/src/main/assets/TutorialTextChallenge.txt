So, you finaly made it. It's about time. 
Hmm? You are wondering who I am? 
That's unconsequential... for the moment. 
I have a task for you. A simple one I'm sure you 
can figure out. Just break through this firewall as 
someone locked us out of the system and we can't get 
back online until we do so. I would do it myself, 
but we need someone to monitor the situation, that's 
why I'm asking you. Just click the bricks until it's all gone.
I'll wait until you are done.
